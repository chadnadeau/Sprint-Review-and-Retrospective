# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
CS-250 Final Project


How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

- Interpreting someones personal thoughts and ideas can often times be difficult. Asking as many questions as possible and making sure that you leave the conversation with an understanding of what the user is requesting will leave little to no room for error. Having these user stories are the best instance of use cases because it allows for the user to have a say in what they wish to see in the new product. Having these user stories gives the opportunity of having insight to what the user wishes to see and how they wish to see it, therefore having a direction to follow as development commences.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

- Development is not one single person's job, development as whole is a collaborative effort. Approaching developing programs is something that can be done in several different ways, but leaning on your team and making sure that you have the correct guidance and understanding of how everyone operates will only set yourself up for success. In the future, I can only hope that I get involved with scrum events as a whole. Going through the course work and readings, I was able to see how efficient and effective scrum can be in a team environment.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

- Although it may seem like a simple question, there is no right answer. Being a good team member all depends on who you are working with and how they want to see you itneract with the team as a whole. Although, making sure you are prompt with your work, thorough with your work, responding to questions if you know the answer, and making sure to ask as many questions as you can to obtain more knowledge and show your engagement in learning, are great starting points. Getting to know your teammates and understand how they see the team succeeding is only going to set you up for productive and impressionable projects.
